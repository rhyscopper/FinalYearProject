# FinalYearProject
I created this for my project in my final year of my bachelors, i created a running GUI/program in Java which takes a Transcript file in XML format and a media file as input. When inputted, it allows users to play and manipulate the media file, with the transcripts of the file being printed and also being passed to a classifier to extract the primary emotions portrayed in the each segment of the video and displaying the results of this on a graph back to the user, all in real time.
